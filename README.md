## Accelerate 2024 Workshop Materials

_The materials in this repository are intended for use during the Pure Accelerate 2024 Automation Workshop session._

The Icons below will take you to the login page for the Pure Test Drives. You will use the supplied username and password on the screen in the front of the room to login to access that solution. Please do not launch multiple instances of a lab as it may slow everyone else's labs down as well.

** _Note: These credentials are allowed for all the labs in the workshop. Please do not share these credentials with anyone else. They will expire during the conference._ **

You may continue to use the labs after Accelerate 2024 by signing up for a free account at [Pure Test Drive](https://www.purestorage.com/products/flasharray-x/test-drive.html) and obtaining a voucher from your Account Team.
